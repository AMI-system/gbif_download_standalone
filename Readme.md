# GBIF Download Standalone

This repo is purely for the purposes of downloading images from GBIF using species lists. 

- moth_nonmoth_dataset.ipynb: downloads images of moths and non-moths in the uk
- moth_nonmoth_dataset.py: does the same but can be executed in background (`nohup moth_nonmoth_dataset.py`)
